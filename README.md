# About Me
Howdy, I'm Sherrie! I'm a passionate software developer with over 5 years of experience building web and mobile applications. Originally from Houston, Texas, I've always been fascinated by technology and its ability to empower people and businesses.

# Education & Work
I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. After graduation, I landed my first job as a front-end developer at a startup in Austin, where I gained hands-on experience with modern web technologies like React and Angular.

In 2018, I moved back to Houston to join a leading e-commerce company as a full-stack developer. In this role, I honed my skills in building scalable, high-performance applications using Node.js and MongoDB. I also had the opportunity to work on exciting projects, including developing a mobile app for the company's customers.

# Skills & Interests
I'm a versatile developer who loves tackling new challenges and learning new technologies. My areas of expertise include:

Front-end development using React, Angular, and Vue.js
Back-end development using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB
Mobile app development using React Native and Swift
Cloud infrastructure using AWS and Google Cloud Platform
When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking, playing guitar, and volunteering at local tech events to help inspire the next generation of developers.
